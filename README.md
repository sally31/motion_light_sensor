auto light sensor

## Required Hardware
* Arduino uno
* HC-SR04
* Piezo buzzer 12V

## Introduction

This sensor is for the light that automtically turns on and off. When you go to the toilet the light will automatically turn on then
if you spend some time it will automatically turn off but sometimes you will jumped when the light suddenly turn off
so I made some warning time that tell you it's gonna turn off the light.

What I did is when the sensor is low light will start flashing for 5 seconds then after that it will flash faster for 5 seconds
that warning you it will turn off.
