auto light sensor

## whatyou need
arduino uno, HC-SR04, Piezo buzzer 12V

## introduction
this sensor is for tha light that utomtically turnon and off. When you go to toilet the light will automatically turn on then
if you spend some times it will automatically turn off but sometimes you will jumped when the light suddenly turn off
so I made some warning time that tell you it's gonna turn ohh the light.
whet I did is when the sensor is low light will start flashing for 5 seconds then after that it will flash faster for 5 seconds
that warning you it will turn off.
